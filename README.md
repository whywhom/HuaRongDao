一个传统的小游戏

Huarong Pass (Huarong dao 华容道) is a sliding block puzzle that's popular throughout China. Its story is based on a well known encounter during the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220) between Cao Cao, the shrewd and clever strategist for the Wei Kingdom, and Guan Yu, a commander in the Shu Kingdom army who had once served under Cao Cao.
